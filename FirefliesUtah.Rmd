# Abstract

# Background

# Study questions and Hypothesis

## Questions
How do geographic location and biome type impact Utah firefly population size? How does this change North to South?

## Hypothesis
While Southern Utah grows warmer sooner, the higher forestation and more marshlands in Northern Utah will lead to higher Firefly populations in Norther Utah than Southern Utah.

## Prediction
There will be higher firefly popuations in Northern than Southern Utah

# Methods
This data on firefly populations was collected as a citizen science effort, wherein data submissions were open to the general public, as opposed to just those of a scientific background. This information was then cleaned up by the collection team and then our team did further cleaning up of the data (expanding abbreviations, clarifying negative values that aught to have been positive, and removing irrelevant information)

## First Analysis - Boxplot
```{r}
# Firefly Boxplot

# Load needed packages
library(ggplot2)
library(stringi)

# Read in the data
fireflies <- read.csv("Copy of firefliesUtah - Usable Data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Rename columns to simpler names
colnames(fireflies) <- c("firefly_count", "region")

# Diagnostics
cat("Original region values:\n")
print(unique(fireflies$region))
cat("\nCounts by region (before cleaning):\n")
print(as.data.frame(table(region = fireflies$region, useNA = "ifany")))

# Replace blanks with NA
fireflies$region[fireflies$region == ""] <- NA

# Normalize
fireflies$region <- stri_trans_general(fireflies$region, "NFKC")

# Remove invisible characters
fireflies$region <- stri_replace_all_regex(fireflies$region, "\\p{C}", "")

# Convert non-breaking spaces to regular and trim spaces
fireflies$region <- gsub("\u00A0", " ", fireflies$region)
fireflies$region <- trimws(fireflies$region)

# Convert to lowercase
fireflies$region <- tolower(fireflies$region)

# Fix obvious typos or abbreviations
fireflies$region[fireflies$region %in% c("n", "nrth", "noth")] <- "north"
fireflies$region[fireflies$region %in% c("s", "sth", "soth")] <- "south"

# Keep valid categories
fireflies$region <- factor(fireflies$region, levels = c("north", "south"))
fireflies_clean <- droplevels(subset(fireflies, !is.na(region)))

# Check column names
cat("\nUnique cleaned region values:\n")
print(unique(fireflies_clean$region))
cat("\nCounts by region (after cleaning):\n")
print(as.data.frame(table(region = fireflies_clean$region)))

#Box Plot
ggplot(fireflies_clean, aes(x = region, y = firefly_count, fill = region)) +
geom_boxplot(width = 0.6, color = "black", alpha = 0.7) + # clean, solid boxes
labs(
title = "Firefly Abundance by Region",
x = "Region",
y = "Firefly Count"
) +
scale_fill_manual(values = c("north" = "#8EC9E8", "south" = "#F4A261")) + # subtle professional palette
coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50)) +
theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
theme(
legend.position = "none",
plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
axis.title = element_text(size = 13),
panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
)
